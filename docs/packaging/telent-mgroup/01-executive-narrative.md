# DIIaC — Executive Narrative for Telent / M Group

## Purpose
This document explains, in board-level terms, why DIIaC exists, what risk it addresses, and why it is commercially relevant in a Microsoft Copilot–first enterprise.

This is not an AI capability pitch.
This is decision governance infrastructure.

## The Problem We Actually Have

Microsoft Copilot is already:
- Approved
- Licensed
- Embedded in Teams, Word, Excel, and PowerPoint

The reality:
- Business-critical content is already being drafted with Copilot.
- Bids, procurement evaluations, customer assurances, and strategy papers now contain AI-assisted material.

The risk is not that AI is inaccurate.
The risk is that **no one can later prove**:
- what rules were applied,
- what evidence existed at the time,
- what risks were known,
- who was accountable.

This creates:
- bid risk,
- procurement challenge risk,
- regulatory exposure,
- board confidence gaps.

## What DIIaC Changes

DIIaC does not replace Copilot.
DIIaC governs **when Copilot output is allowed to become operational**.

It introduces:
- Deterministic policy enforcement
- Explicit risk classification
- Immutable evidence capture
- Repeatable, auditable outcomes

The result:
Copilot outputs become **enterprise-defensible artefacts**.

## Why This Matters to Telent / M Group

Telent and M Group operate in environments where:
- bids must be defensible,
- procurement decisions must withstand audit,
- customer commitments must be provable,
- strategy must be reviewable months later.

DIIaC turns AI-assisted drafting from:
> “Helpful but risky”

into:
> “Governed, bounded, and accountable”

This is the difference between **using AI** and **operationalising AI safely**.

## What DIIaC Is (and Is Not)

### DIIaC Is
- Deterministic governance infrastructure
- A policy and evidence layer
- A risk-signalling system
- Compatible with Microsoft Copilot

### DIIaC Is Not
- An AI assistant
- A model host
- A decision-maker
- A replacement for human accountability

If every AI model disappeared tomorrow, DIIaC would still function exactly the same.

---

## Board-Level Outcome

DIIaC allows leadership to say, truthfully:

> “We use Copilot,  
> but critical outputs are governed, risk-classified, and evidenced.”

That statement materially reduces organisational risk.

That is the value proposition.
