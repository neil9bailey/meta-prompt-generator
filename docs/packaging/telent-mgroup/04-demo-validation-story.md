# Demo & Validation Story — What We Prove

## Purpose
This document defines the narrative and proof points for demonstrations and due diligence.

---

## What the Demo Is

- A real, deterministic governance run
- Against realistic Copilot-style input
- Producing a governed artefact

---

## What the Demo Is Not

- Not an AI performance demo
- Not a prompt-engineering showcase
- Not model-dependent

---

## The Core Proof

The demo proves:
- Determinism
- Policy enforcement
- Risk classification
- Evidence capture

If rerun with the same input, the result is identical.

---

## Demo Flow (High Level)

1. Show ungoverned draft content
2. Invoke DIIaC governed mode
3. Observe deterministic validation result
4. Review risk classification
5. Inspect ledger evidence
6. Present final governed report

---

## Why This Matters

The audience should conclude:

> “This is not about better AI.  
> This is about safer decisions.”

That is the validation target.
