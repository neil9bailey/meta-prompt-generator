1\. Current State Baseline

The organisation operates as a UK-based critical national infrastructure (CNI) entity with high availability, safety, and regulatory obligations. The current technology estate shows the following characteristics:

Architecture and Infrastructure





Predominantly hybrid estate with legacy on-premise data centres and incremental public cloud adoption





Fragmented application portfolio with mixed levels of lifecycle management and technical debt





Inconsistent platform standardisation across environments





Limited automation in infrastructure provisioning and configuration management





Cloud Strategy





Tactical cloud adoption driven by individual projects rather than enterprise architecture





Absence of a formal cloud operating model or landing zone standards





Inconsistent security and compliance controls across cloud workloads





Security Posture





Strong perimeter and endpoint controls, but uneven zero-trust implementation





Security tooling is partially integrated; telemetry is siloed





Incident response processes exist but are not consistently rehearsed at enterprise scale





Regulatory compliance is achieved but heavily manual





Data Governance





Data ownership is unclear across business domains





Inconsistent data classification and retention practices





Limited enterprise data architecture and metadata management





Analytics capabilities are fragmented and not systematically governed





Operating Model





Technology delivery is largely project-centric with weak product ownership





Separation between infrastructure, security, and application teams creates delivery friction





Vendor management is reactive rather than strategic





Skills and Capability





Skills concentration around legacy platforms





Shortage of cloud architecture, cyber engineering, and data engineering capability





Limited formal succession planning for critical roles







2\. Target State (12–24 Months)

The target state is a secure, resilient, and standardised hybrid architecture aligned with regulatory expectations and operational resilience requirements.

Architecture and Infrastructure





Standardised hybrid platform with defined reference architectures





Infrastructure-as-Code and automated configuration management as default





Consolidated and modernised application portfolio with defined lifecycle governance





Cloud Strategy





Enterprise cloud landing zones with embedded security and compliance controls





Clear workload placement strategy (on-prem vs cloud vs edge)





Cloud FinOps discipline integrated into budgeting and forecasting





Security





Zero-trust-aligned architecture covering identity, network, and workload security





Centralised security telemetry with automated detection and response





Regular enterprise incident simulations and resilience exercises





Data Governance





Formal data ownership model with accountable data stewards





Enterprise data catalogue and classification framework





Governed analytics platform supporting operational and regulatory reporting





Operating Model





Product-oriented delivery model aligned to business capabilities





Integrated DevSecOps practices embedded in delivery pipelines





Strategic vendor partnerships with performance governance





Skills





Structured capability framework covering cloud, cyber, and data domains





Targeted recruitment and upskilling programme





Defined succession planning for critical technology roles







3\. Assumptions





Regulatory requirements will tighten around operational resilience and cyber security





Funding remains stable over the 24-month horizon





Existing core systems will remain in service during transition





Cloud providers maintain UK/EU sovereign hosting options





Workforce attrition remains within industry norms







4\. Constraints





Legacy systems with limited modernisation pathways





Regulatory approval cycles affecting architectural change





Budgetary controls linked to multi-year capital planning





Skills scarcity in specialised cyber and cloud domains





Dependency on long-term vendor contracts







5\. Key Strategic Decisions





Adopt a Standardised Hybrid Cloud Architecture

Decision Owner: Group CTO

Establish enterprise landing zones and workload placement rules.





Implement Zero-Trust Security Architecture

Decision Owner: Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)

Mandate identity-centric access and micro-segmentation.





Create an Enterprise Data Governance Framework

Decision Owner: Chief Data Officer (CDO)

Formalise ownership, classification, and lifecycle management.





Shift to a Product-Centric Operating Model

Decision Owner: Chief Technology Officer \& CIO jointly

Align teams to business capabilities with accountable product leads.





Standardise DevSecOps Tooling and Pipelines

Decision Owner: Head of Engineering

Embed security and compliance in automated delivery.





Establish Strategic Vendor Ecosystem

Decision Owner: Chief Procurement Officer with CTO oversight

Rationalise suppliers and formalise performance governance.







6\. Dependencies





Regulatory engagement and approval processes





Vendor roadmap alignment





Availability of specialist recruitment





Enterprise architecture governance effectiveness





Funding approvals and capital allocation cycles







7\. Risks and Mitigations

Risk: Cloud misconfiguration leading to regulatory breach

Mitigation: Standardised landing zones, automated compliance scanning

Risk: Skills shortage delaying delivery

Mitigation: Early recruitment, training partnerships, managed services augmentation

Risk: Legacy integration failure

Mitigation: Phased migration strategy and architecture review gates

Risk: Vendor lock-in reducing flexibility

Mitigation: Multi-vendor strategy and contractual exit clauses

Risk: Cyber incident during transition

Mitigation: Parallel security hardening and active threat monitoring



8\. Delivery Roadmap

Phase 1 (0–6 months): Foundations





Define enterprise architecture standards





Establish cloud landing zones





Launch data governance framework





Begin operating model transition pilots





Phase 2 (6–12 months): Implementation





Migrate priority workloads





Deploy centralised security monitoring





Standardise DevSecOps pipelines





Recruit key specialist roles





Phase 3 (12–24 months): Optimisation





Complete major migrations





Embed FinOps and performance governance





Conduct enterprise resilience exercises





Formalise continuous improvement processes







9\. Ownership and Accountability





Group CTO: Overall strategy execution and architecture governance





CISO: Security architecture and risk management





CDO: Data governance and analytics platforms





CIO: Operating model transition and service delivery





Head of Engineering: Delivery pipelines and technical standards





Chief Procurement Officer: Vendor governance





Each executive owns quarterly measurable outcomes reported to the board.



10\. Board Summary

The strategy establishes a secure, standardised hybrid technology platform that strengthens operational resilience, regulatory compliance, and delivery efficiency over the next 24 months. It prioritises zero-trust security, governed cloud adoption, disciplined data management, and a product-centric operating model supported by targeted skills investment. Execution risk is controlled through phased delivery, explicit ownership, and measurable governance. This programme positions the organisation to meet escalating regulatory expectations while improving service reliability and long-term cost efficiency.
